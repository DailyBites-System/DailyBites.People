# DailyBites.People
The authentication and user management service for DailyBite. It handles user registration, login, and authorization, generating secure JWT tokens (via huzcodes.Extensions) to control access to the platform services.  This way, both Recipes API and People API descriptions are consistent and look professional in your documentation.
